      <p class = "introText">But the 2020 Census faces unprecedented challenges and threats to its accuracy. Demographic changes over the past decade will make the population harder to count.

      </p>


      <p class = "footerAbout">Our miscount assessments are quantitative but not meant to be used for statistical inference. There are no margins of error or significance levels available. Our goal is to provide some sense of the 2020 Census&rsquo;s potential outcomes under a few scenarios that we subjectively deemed realistic.</p>

      <p class = "footerAbout">Population projections have been rounded to the nearest hundred. Population projections for the different racial and ethnic groups do not add up to the overall population projection because the Census Bureau&rsquo;s projection data do not separate the Hispanic/Latinx designation from any race except for white. The term &ldquo;Hispanic/Latinx&rdquo; is used throughout this feature to reflect the different ways in which people self-identify.</p>


      <p class = "footerAbout">Our miscount projections are based on findings about the 2010 Census performance from the <a href = "https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/coverage-measurement.html" target = "_blank">Census Coverage Measurement Program&rsquo;s Post Enumeration Survey</a>. For our projections of children younger than 5, we also use <a href = "https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319189161" target = "_blank">demographic analysis</a>.

      <p class = "footerAbout">In the low-risk scenario, we assume the 2020 Census will perform as the 2010 Census did. The 2010 Census was considered one of the most accurate in recent history, but it still miscounted subpopulations. We assume US age patterns, race and ethnic distribution, and the proportion of renters will all have changed by 2020, but the miscount rates for each group will be the same as they were in the 2010 Census.
      </p>
      <p class = "footerAbout">In the medium-risk scenario, we assume that, beyond demographic changes, the Census Bureau will achieve the initial self-response rate (including via the internet) it expects and that all operations will happen as the Bureau projects in its <a href = "https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/planning-docs/operational-plan.html" target = "_blank">2020 Operational Plan</a>. This scenario also assumes that nonresponse follow-up cases will follow the Bureau&rsquo;s process changes for the 2020 Census, which include reducing the number of nonresponse follow-up contact attempts from six to one and relying more heavily on administrative records to predict housing status and fill data gaps.
      </p>
      <p class = "footerAbout">In the high-risk scenario, we use the baseline assumptions about 2020 Census operations from the medium-risk scenario (demographic and process changes) but assume the lowest self-response rate for which the Census Bureau is planning. In this scenario, we also assume lower response rates among the Hispanic/Latinx and immigrant populations because of the political climate regarding immigration and the potential addition of the citizenship question. This means that a greater share of households would be handled through the Bureau&rsquo;s new nonresponse follow-up processes, which would lead to greater miscounts overall.
